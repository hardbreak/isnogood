# Licenses for the pics
To avoid legal problems, all images used in connection with the application should have license
information. Copyright infringements are often asserted by adverse lawyers, even if this is not
always legally correct. In order to avoid problems in this respect, care should be taken to ensure
that the images used can always be used in a comprehensible and legal manner. No commercial use
is intended, images that are commercially usable, e.g. have a CC0 license, are the most uncritical
and therefore preferable.

**Please do not rename pics unless you also rename it here.**
